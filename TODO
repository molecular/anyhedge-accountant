TODO

 * Use BigNumber or Decimal for amount comparisons
 * offer formatted output columns for amounts, times
 * in case user supplies wallet data, simplify (and make more reliable) prefunding_tx identification and derived.fundingAmountInSatoshis calculation


 * somehow register and output negative premium payments (it's an output to payout_address in funding tx)
 * somehow identify and output refunds
